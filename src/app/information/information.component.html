<h2>Player Implementations</h2>
<p>There are multiple implementations to compete with each others</p>

<h3>Player - Human</h3>
<p>The Player Human is YOU! Just click on the board to play.</p>

<h3>Robot - Random</h3>
<p>The dumbest player! It just randomly choose a free cell.</p>

<h3>Robot - Minimax</h3>
<p>The 'perfect' player! But also the slowest. It tries out all possible combinations to decide the best move.</p>

    In additional to the simple rules to categories WIN, DRAW and LOSS, this minimax implementation has two
    improvements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Uses the <b>depth</b> in the score to prefer winning faster and losing slower.</li>
    <li>Small adjustment of the score to prefer <b>DRAW</b>s with higher possibilities to win and lower possibilities to lose</li>
</ul>
